# Pokemon_Master

This was a Codeacademy project. Tried my hand at this when I was learning python at Code Academy. 
Project description:
In this project, I created several Python Classes to create a game system similar to the popular game series Pokémon. 
In this project Trainer Class and Pokemon Class interact with each other to create Pokémon battles!
